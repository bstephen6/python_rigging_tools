# little script I made so that I could test out creating superClasses and subClasses where the initialization arguements of the superClass 
# would be inherited to the subClass along while simultaneously establishing additional initialization arguements for the subClass
# on top of the original superClass's initialization arguements, rather than just the subClass inheriting the superClass's arguements.
