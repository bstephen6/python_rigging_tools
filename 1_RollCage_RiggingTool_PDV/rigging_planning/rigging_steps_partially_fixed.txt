User end steps in maya:
lay joints

	!!!! even specialty joints !!!!! ( wing, helpers, expression ctl placeholder joints)

rotate them

Steps:

	SETTING UP FOR CTL RIG:

		1* import ctl files ( WILL LIST LATER)
			need list:

		2* change names ( change-able in program)

		3* scale Ctls

		4* Duplicated for the desired amount of joints per ctl

		5* Snap all joints except feet ctls to the joints with the precurser name
		
		6* Move Foot CTLs to ankle position in X and Z channels
	
		6.5* snap foot ctl pivot to ankle Joint 

		
		7* put the joints in the correct hierarchy


		8* take all joints rotations and change them to the orientations
		
		
		9* mirror any side specific joints (for tool there should be symetrical checkbox for this)
		

		10* duplicate, rename, and Snap pivots any side specific ctls ( this also works on the symetrical checkbox)
	

		11* Freeze all ctls

	
		12* group , rename groups, and Snap pivots of all ctl to their proper joints
		

		13* take joint orients and make them the ctl group rotations 
		

		14* mirror right side ctls through the ctl group rotation of 180 degrees in certain channels
			elbow: 180 on y : freeze and then 180 on x on group

		15* create attributes for all specialties 


		16* (create specialties) WITHOUT EXPRESSIONS [BREAK THIS UP INTO STEPS] !! -> [Give Variables to change the channels expressions operate on]
					16.1* foot rolls **
					16.2* Wings and Flap
					16.3* helper joints
					16.4* IK handles    **(UPDATE! : this should go before joint mirroring!)
					16.5 IK/fk Switches (UPDATE! : go back and make a version that works without having shoulder helper joints)
					16.6  STRETCHY SPINE! **

					16.7  Hair Dynamics
					16.8  Weapon Switcher
					16.9  Root Switcher
					

     		 			Hide all locators at the end of this

		17* Delete placeholder joints 

		18* lock attributes on the expressions ctls ( make a check list of what to lock in the programm)

			(maybe stick all the expression ctl curves into an array and perform for every object in array)


		19* put ctls into proper hierarchy

		20* Add expressions ( variables taken from ctl group info) 

		21* Constraint joints and ctls

		22* select all joints exempting the base and root joints

		23* select mesh and bind skin with 3 influences
		
		

	

		
		ideas: make a changeable variable for th

IDEA FOR PYTHON FUNCTION!!!!:
for there to be an edit size of joint CTLS button that undo's everything just done by the python code and than
to perform the same actions except with the change of handle sizes
