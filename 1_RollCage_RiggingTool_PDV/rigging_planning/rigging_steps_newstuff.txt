User end steps in maya:
lay joints

	!!!! even specialty joints !!!!! ( wing, helpers, expression ctl placeholder joints)

rotate them

Steps:

	SETTING UP FOR CTL RIG:

		*import ctl files ( WILL LIST LATER)
			need list:
		*change names ( change-able in program)
		*scale Ctls
		*Duplicated for the desired amount of joints per ctl
		*Snap to the joints with the precurser name
			FOOT CTL NEEDS PLACE HOLDER FOR LOCATION THE PIVOT SNAPPED TO JOINT
			( foot could also take the translation of the ankle minus the height and pivot snap)
		
		
		*put the joints in the correct hierarchy


		*take all joints rotations and change them to the orientations
		
		
		*mirror any side specific joints (for tool there should be symetrical checkbox for this)
		

		*duplicate, rename &  snap any side specific ctls ( this also works on the symetrical checkbox)

		*Freeze all ctls
	
		
				*(create specialties) WITHOUT EXPRESSIONS
					*foot rolls
					*Wings and Flap
					*helper joints
					*IK handles
					*IK/fk Switches
     		 Hide all locators at the end of this 
	

		*Delete placeholder joints 


		* create attributes for all specialties 


		*group , rename groups, and Snap pivots of all ctl to their proper joints 

		*take joint orients and make them the ctl group rotations

		*mirror right side ctls through the ctl groups

		*lock attributes on the expressions ctls

		*put ctls into proper hierarchy

		*Add expressions ( variables taken from ctl group info) 

		*Constraint joints and ctls

		*select all joints exempting the base and root joints

		* select mesh and bind skin with 3 influences

IDEA FOR PYTHON FUNCTION!!!!:
for there to be an edit size of joints button that undo's everything just done by the python code and than
to perform the same actions except with the change of handle sizes
